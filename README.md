# stats220

## By Zaid Salman

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

**A little about me:**

- _I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science_
- _I am taking STATS 220 because I am intrigued by Data Science_
- _I am interested in learning about the ways Statistics and Computer Science intersect._

**My top 3 bands:**
1. _Radiohead_
2. _The Strokes_
3. _My Chemical Romance_

Here's a video I really like (from my Uncle Richard):
